# AIX UI — Design Governance Index

This directory is the **Git-tracked design governance record** for the AIX
UI. Per the project's authoritative-in-Git principle, every meaningful
approved UI decision — direction, references, tokens, measurement rules,
component rules, responsive rules, navigation architecture, important UX
decisions, page acceptance records — must eventually be recorded here, not
only carried in chat memory.

## Status

**UI Phase 0A — Design Governance Foundation: COMPLETE.**
**UI Phase 0B — Visual Reference + Measurement Specification: COMPLETE.**
**UI Phase 1A — Frontend Technical Foundation: COMPLETE.**
**UI Phase 1B — Floating-Pill Public Navigation: VISUALLY ACCEPTED.** The
first real AIX visual component
(`platform/apps/web/components/site/public-header.tsx`, `PublicHeader`) —
implemented at `537c71d`, remediated at `47c0f1a` — is accepted by user
visual review at 1440px, 1024px, 768px, and 430/440px. The original
768px (`md:`) full-desktop threshold was rejected as visibly compressed;
Remediation 01 moved the full-desktop/compact-mobile switch to `lg:`
(1024px), and the resulting responsive rule (full desktop ≥1024px,
compact floating navigation <1024px) is accepted at every tested width.
`47c0f1a` is the accepted implementation baseline. REF-UI-001's floating-
pill concept was successfully adapted, not copied — its scope remains
unchanged (treatment only, never Phantom's branding/colors/typography).
**Not accepted by this turn:** a final AIX color palette, a final font, a
final brand asset/logo, or the full public website — the header still
uses new, explicitly provisional, public-marketing-scope-only tokens, and
shrink-on-scroll remains explicitly deferred. See
[`AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md) §10.6–§10.8
and [`AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md)
§19 for the full implementation record, findings, and deferred items.
**UI Phase 1C — Public Landing Hero: IMPLEMENTED, PENDING USER VISUAL
REVIEW.** The second real AIX visual component
(`platform/apps/web/components/site/public-hero.tsx`, `PublicHero`) adds
only the header + hero (no feature/pricing/footer/testimonial/dashboard
content) — the accepted `PublicHeader` is unchanged. Headline/copy avoid
every prohibited regulatory claim; the product-preview panel illustrates
the real, already-backed IAM-02 maker-checker workflow, explicitly
labeled "Demo preview," with no fabricated figures. **No new package, no
new shadcn component, no final color/font/brand-asset approval.** See
[`AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md) §21
and [`AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md)
§20 for the full implementation record.

## Contents

- [`AIX_UI_DESIGN_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_DESIGN_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md)
  (`UI-01`, DRAFT) — design philosophy, shadcn rule, public-vs-platform
  visual modes, anti-"AI look" rules, measurement discipline, provisional
  spacing foundation, responsive rules, token policy, floating-pill-
  navigation concept, backend-reality rule, regulatory UI boundary,
  reference register, portal categories, model-use guidance, and UI
  implementation discipline.
- [`AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_MEASUREMENT_SPEC_v0.1.md)
  (`UI-02`, DRAFT) — the measurable specification built on `UI-01`:
  spacing tokens, control-height system, radius hierarchy, typography
  roles, content-width categories, page gutters, the full floating-pill-
  navigation geometry (desktop/tablet/mobile, sticky/scroll behavior,
  radius/border/shadow), visual QA tolerances, grid/alignment rules, icon
  sizes, and table/form/color direction. Every dimension is PROVISIONAL
  and/or DESIGN REVIEW REQUIRED, not final-approved.
- [`AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md`](AIX_UI_FRONTEND_TECHNICAL_FOUNDATION_v0.1.md)
  (`UI-03`, DRAFT / CONTROLLED IMPLEMENTATION FOUNDATION) — the actual
  `platform/apps/web/` runtime: npm-workspace integration, exact installed
  versions, shadcn/Tailwind initialization decisions (and what was
  overridden from their defaults — font, one stray accent color),
  TypeScript model, directory structure, verification performed, and
  every deferred decision. Toolchain only — no visual design accepted.
- [`references/`](references/) — reference image storage.
  [`REF-UI-001`](references/REF-UI-001_phantom-floating-pill.png) is
  registered; see [`references/README.md`](references/README.md) for the
  registration rule.

## Companion Project Skill

`.claude/skills/aix-ui-design/SKILL.md` — the project-local Claude Code
skill that enforces this directory's discipline during UI work (inspect
docs first, measure explicitly, reject generic AI visual patterns, preserve
backend/regulatory truth, prefer-but-customize shadcn primitives, focused
diffs, responsive + screenshot-based visual QA). Invoked automatically for
AIX UI/frontend/design work; see the skill file itself for its exact
trigger description.

## Relationship to Backend Governance

This directory is a peer of `03_implementation/` (backend build-order and
deployment-perimeter governance), not a replacement for it. UI work is
governed by the rules here **in addition to**, never instead of, the
backend-reality and regulatory-boundary constraints recorded in
`01_masters/`, `02_modules/`, `OPEN_FINDINGS.md`, and `DECISION_LOG.md`. A
UI decision that contradicts an approved backend/regulatory position is a
defect in the UI decision, not grounds to reinterpret the backend position.

## Future Structure (not created yet)

As UI work proceeds, this directory is expected to grow — for example,
finalized design-token files, page/screen acceptance records, and
navigation-architecture documents. **Do not pre-create empty structure for
work that has not happened yet** — add files here only when a turn actually
produces the content they would hold.
